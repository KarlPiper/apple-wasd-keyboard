# Apple WASD Keyboards—Custom Layout
**Character Styles**
* Normal—sets SF Compact Text Light, inherited by other styles
* Modifiers—keys with full words printed out (except media keys)
* Functions—F keys
* Stacked Keys—keys with two stacked legends (not numbers)
* Stacked Keys (tall)—used on {, }, |
* Denominator—lower character on number keys, larger
* Numerator—upper character on number keys, smaller
* Media keys—media key cluster + numpad “clear” and “enter”

**Alignment**
Some keys required optical centering, e.g. J, L, Q, P, F, delete.

**Stylistic Alternates**
I chose to use the straight 6, straight 9, and slashed 0.
“*” was switched out for SF Mono Light.
Actual x, +, -, / characters used on numpad.

**System Font Symbols**
Basic set of keyboard symbols were exported from the following fonts:

* Apple Symbols
* Arial Unicode MS
* .Keyboard
* Lucida Grande
* Lucida Grande Bold
* .Lucida Grande UI
* .Lucida Grande UI Bold
* Menlo Regular
* Menlo Bold

* New keyboards seem to use the alternative key symbol. It’s wider, and is not upside down in *Apple Symbols*.
* Enter ≠ Return
	* Apple uses the left hooked arrow rather than the actual return symbol.
* Backspace ≠ Delete
	* The backspace key is labeled "Delete"
	* The delete key has the delete symbol
* The Function Key has no symbol
