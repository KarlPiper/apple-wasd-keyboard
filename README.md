# Apple WASD Keyboards—Custom Layout

## Text

RIP Vag Rounded, SF is in now. Fonts used are *SF Compact Text Light*, and *SF Compact Text Regular*.

## Symbols

I made reference PDFs of the basic keyboard symbols available in Mac system fonts.
These can be opened in Illustrator and edited/used.
Files exported using FontExplorer X Pro.

SF includes no symbols. :[

- The Option Key on new keyboards seem to use the alternative key symbol.
It is upside down in all fonts except *Apple Symbols*.
- Enter ≠ Return
  - Apple uses the left hooked arrow rather than the actual return symbol.
- Backspace ≠ Delete
  - The Backspace Key is labeled with the text: "Delete".
  - The Delete Key is labeled with the "Delete" symbol.
- The Function Key has no symbol.
